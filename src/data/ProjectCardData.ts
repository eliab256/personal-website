The contract must track the total balance, the manager’s address, the fundraising goal, the number of donors, and whether the campaign is closed. It should allow people to donate Ether, update the donor count, let only the manager withdraw funds, enable closing the campaign, and verify whether the fundraising goal has been reached.",

To achieve this, we are creating a DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which allows users to participate directly in the governance of the platform. The governance model can be set up in two ways: with direct democracy, where each member votes on every decision, or with liquid democracy, which allows members to vote directly or delegate their vote to someone else, providing flexibility and representative decision-making. Through the governance smart contract, users can become members of the DAO by purchasing shares in exchange for ERC-20 tokens at a fixed price. Administrators will have the ability to close the token sale, finalizing the initial phase. Members will be able to propose decisions to be voted on, and each vote will be weighted according to the number of shares held. Decisions that achieve a majority of weighted votes will be approved, and all proposals and voting activity will be recorded on the contract to ensure transparency. Members will be able to vote for, against, or optionally abstain from a decision. Certain decisions may also involve transferring ERC-20 tokens from the DAO to an external Ethereum address. Finally, the contract will be thoroughly tested using Hardhat to ensure security, reliability, and proper functionality.",

Users can mint NFTs with distinct traits, view metadata and collection details, and trade them using standard ERC721 functions. The contract also defines creation costs and limits for the collection. Each NFT unlocks advanced yoga courses and coach feedback, while the random attributes enable a gamified loyalty system that rewards lucky users with special sessions, discounts, or other perks. The contract is carefully tested using Foundry and deployed on the Sepolia test network, combining blockchain technology, gamification, and personalized yoga training to engage users in a unique way.",
